### Seven-segment display decoder

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`tb_hex_7seg.vhd`) with asserts. Verify all input combinations. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
begin
    uut_hex_7seg : entity work.hex_7seg
        port map(
            hex_i           => s_hex,
            seg_o           => s_seg

        );

    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        s_hex <= "0000"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0001"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0010"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0011"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0100"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0101"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0110"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "0111"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1000"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1001"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1010"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1011"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1100"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1101"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1110"; wait for 100 ns;
        s_hex <= "1111"; wait for 100 ns;

        
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    
    
    end process p_stimulus;

end architecture testbench;
```

2. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!

### LED(7:4) indicators

1. Listing of LEDs(7:4) part of VHDL architecture from source file `top.vhd`. Try to write logic functions as simple as possible. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity top is
    Port ( 
           SW : in STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (4 - 1 downto 0);
           CA : out STD_LOGIC;
           CB : out STD_LOGIC;
           CC : out STD_LOGIC;
           CD : out STD_LOGIC;
           CE : out STD_LOGIC;
           CF : out STD_LOGIC;
           CG : out STD_LOGIC;
           
           LED : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (8 - 1 downto 0);
           AN : out STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (8 - 1 downto 0)
          );
end top;

architecture Behavioral of top is

begin

    hex2seg : entity work.hex_7seg
        port map(
            hex_i    => SW,
            seg_o(6) => CA,
            seg_o(5) => CB,
            seg_o(4) => CC,
            seg_o(3) => CD,
            seg_o(2) => CE,
            seg_o(1) => CF,
            seg_o(0) => CG
        );
    -- Connect one common anode to 3.3V
    AN <= b"1111_0111";

    -- Display input value on LEDs
    LED(3 downto 0) <= SW;

end Behavioral;
```
